#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person2#: I think cooks generally work at entry level jobs. They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes.
#Person1#: I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef?
#Person2#: I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent.
#Person1#: Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that.
#Person2#: Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed.
#Person1#: Challenging. How long do you work everyday?
#Person2#: 10 to 12 hours a day.
#Person1#: An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me?
#Person2#: Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy.

If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.

#Person1#: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?
#Person2#: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity.
