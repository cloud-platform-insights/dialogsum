People talk quickly, they drive their cars too fast, the good deals go by really quickly...but here in Canada, it seems like people are a little more relaxed.\\n#Person1#: Is that true for everything?\\n#Person2#: No, of course not. In Russia, going to the bank can take hours. The same is true for the post office and the supermarket. In Canada, however, these places are pretty easy to get through quickly.\\n#Person1#: So, what is it that makes some things go either faster or slower compared to us here in Canada? I was born and raised here, so I guess I don't notice these things. I've also never been outside the country before.\\n#Person2#: I think the people in Russia are fast movers by nature, at least in the big cities. Public places are still very slow because they haven't tried to do business any differently than they used to.\\n#Person1#: But in Canada, it's the opposite?\\n#Person2#: Right. The government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better. But I think Canadians are just more calm in general than Russians are... and they're definitely more relaxed than Americans!\\n#Person1#: Well, I agree with you about that last part!\",\n",

I have been reading weather reports for the Caribbean on the internet. They seem to have lots of storms.\\n#Person1#: They certainly do. When we went on a voyage, we stopped at Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. And both had been hit by storms two weeks before.
